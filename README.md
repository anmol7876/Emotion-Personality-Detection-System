# Emotion-Personality-Detection-System
The project presents a comprehensive approach to harnessing the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  technological synergies by developing a system capable of detecting facial emotions and providing insights into the user's personality traits. The proposed system employs a deep learning architecture tailored to the task of facial emotion recognition. By utilizing a rich dataset of labelled facial expressions, the model is trained to accurately recognize a spectrum of emotions, ranging from happiness and sadness to anger and surprise. Then it can predict personality based on the detected emotion.
The datsets I utilized for this project are FER2013 and a synthetically generated "emotion_personality_dataset".
